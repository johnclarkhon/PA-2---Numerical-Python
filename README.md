## Normalization Problem:

This problem creates a random 5 x 5 ndarray, normalize each values using .mean() and .std() calls, then save the normalized ndarray as X_normalized.npy.


## Divisible By 3 Problem:

This problem creates a 10 x 10 ndarray with squares of first 100 positive integers, determine all the elements that are divisible by 3, then save the result as div_by_3.npy
