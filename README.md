# PA2: Numerical Python (NUMPY)
### Name: John Clark D. Honrado
### Section: 2ECE-A
###

This project focuses on using Numpy Library

###

## Requirements before doing the projects:
1. Install the latest version of Python
2. Get Anaconda Navigator installed
3. Make sure to have Numpy library using "pip list" in cmd-administrator to check all the installed libraries, if not type "pip install numpy" to install it

###

## Steps in doing the projects:
1. Open Anaconda Navigator
2. Launch Jupyter Notebook (You will then be redirected to the Web application)
3. On the top-right corner, click New > Python 2 (ipykernel), to create new .ipynb file


###
## Project Descriptions:

### Normalization Problem:

This problem creates a random 5 x 5 ndarray, normalize each values using .mean() and .std() calls, then save the normalized ndarray as X_normalized.npy.


### Divisible By 3 Problem:

This problem creates a 10 x 10 ndarray with squares of first 100 positive integers, determine all the elements that are divisible by 3, then save the result as div_by_3.npy
